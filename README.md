## Project description:
Smartphone usage has become an integral part of daily life for most people
in today’s society, offering new capabilities that can enhance their lives.
TripTracker is an Android application developed in Java that aims to do
just that. It allows users to register and track their daily trips by automatically
detecting when their physical movement indicates the start and end
of a trip, while running in the background.
To ensure optimal battery efficiency, TripTracker utilizes Google’s Fused
Location Provider API, which intelligently combines signals from Wi-Fi,
GPS, and cellular networks to provide efficient location updates to the app.
Additionally, it leverages a low-power step-detect sensor to record movement
data.
TripTracker offers three modes for trip detection: speed-based,
movement-based, and an unsupervised machine learning algorithm
named TDBSCANMode, which is a modified version of the DBSCAN algorithm.
